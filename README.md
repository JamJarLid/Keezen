Current intended functionality is to be able to play a game of Ludo (fia med knuff) on one computer. 
Each player takes turns to roll the dice and select the pawn to move. 
If no legal play can be made, press the "Pass this round" button to start the next player's turn. 
A log turns is available in the web terminal, in order to keep track of whose turn it currently is.

To start the round, click the roll dice button, and click the desired pawn you want to move.
